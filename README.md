# Objectives
 I choose this project for two main reasons : it is real data and it is part of a kaggle competition
 
 The goal is to perform a customer segmentation with an unsupervised learning technique to predict which part
 of the general population should be targeted as future customers.
 Then I used a supervised learning technique on a mailout campaign dataset to predict the response of a person in a
 future campaign.
